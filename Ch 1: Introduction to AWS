# Ch 1: Introduction to AWS #
### **1.1 The Rise of AWS**

In the early 2000s, Amazon faced a problem that most companies would envy ‚Äî their e-commerce platform was growing so fast that their internal infrastructure couldn‚Äôt keep up. Instead of building just enough for their needs, they designed systems to handle enormous spikes in demand (like holiday shopping seasons). Over time, they realized they could offer this infrastructure to the public. In 2006, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** was born.

Fast-forward to today ‚Äî AWS is the market leader in cloud computing, serving millions of customers across startups, enterprises, and governments. From hosting websites to running complex AI workloads, AWS has become the backbone of much of the internet.

### **1.2 What is AWS in Simple Terms?**

Think of AWS as **a huge online toolbox**. Inside, you‚Äôll find:

- **Computers you can rent** (EC2, Lambda)
- **Storage you can use instantly** (S3, EBS, Glacier)
- **Databases you don‚Äôt have to install** (RDS, DynamoDB)
- **Networking tools** to connect your systems (VPC, CloudFront)
- **Machine learning services** (SageMaker)

You pay only for what you use, just like paying for electricity or water.
