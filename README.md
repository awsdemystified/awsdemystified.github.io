# Ch 0: Welcome, future Cloud Professional! #

Today isn’t just another day — it’s the start of your transformation into someone who understands AWS deeply, speaks the language of the cloud, and can confidently pass certifications while applying the skills in the real world.

This **long** program is **built for learners who want more than just an exam pass**. 

With this program our focus is on:

- **Core AWS concepts**
- **Hands-on labs**
- **Practical scenarios**
- **Certification strategies**
- **Ongoing career readiness**

You’ll see me not just as a trainer, but as a **mentor** — someone who will guide you, challenge you, and keep you accountable over the next 90 days.

## 🌟 **The Mindset Shift  — This is important !!**

Before we talk about the program content, here’s something important;

> ***Your mindset will define your success***
> 

You will have moments where life gets busy, the AWS console feels overwhelming, or practice questions frustrate you.

Believe me…..That’s normal…I have gone through that situation and therefore letting you know.

But here’s the difference — you’ll be part of a structure and a system that won’t let you quit.

We’ll go slow enough for you to **truly** *learn*, but *steady* enough to keep you *moving forward*.

## 🕒 **Why 90 Days? Not 30 Days. Not “A Few Weeks.”**

💬 *“Why not just make this a 30-day crash course?”*

> ***Deep, lasting knowledge takes time***
> 

Yes, you could cram for a month and *maybe* pass. But:

- **Short sprints = shallow understanding.** You might pass the exam but struggle in interviews or projects. I have conducted interviews of 100s of candidates but they failed to answer basic questions.
- **AWS is broad.** Even Cloud Practitioner covers 100+ services, pricing, security, architecture patterns.
- **Real skill > paper certification.** I’m here to make sure you can *think like a cloud pro*.

**90 days is the sweet spot:**

- Gives you **repetition** so concepts stick.
- Fits around your **job or studies** without burnout.
- Balances **exam readiness** with **career readiness**.

*But you are free to pick your speed !!*

## 💡 **Your Promise to Yourself**

If you commit to these 90 days, you’re not just walking toward an AWS certification — you’re running toward a **new career**.

I’ll be here with you. Every. Single. Day.
